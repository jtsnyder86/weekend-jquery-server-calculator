## Description

Duration: 2 days

Usage
To use this application, the user will input the desired numbers to be operated (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in the two input fields.  The user will also click the desired operation (+, -, *, /) then to complete the operation they will click the equals button (=). If the user has made a mistake and wants to clear the inputs, there is a clear button to clear the answers, history display, and the inputs.
